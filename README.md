## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the technology or programming language. Each folder contains projects or algorithms related to that specific technology. Here's a quick overview:

```
├── reactproject/        # All React-based projects
│   └── my-react-app/    # Example React project
├── cppalgorithms/       # C++ algorithms and solutions
│   └── sorting-algorithms/ # Sorting algorithms implemented in C++
├── jsprojects/          # JavaScript-based projects
│   └── todo-app/        # Example To-Do list project in vanilla JS
├── pythonproject/       # Python-based projects
│   └── data-analysis/   # Example data analysis project in Python
└── CONTRIBUTING.md      # Contribution guidelines
```

### Technologies

This repository is divided into different folders based on the technology stack:

- **React Projects (`reactproject/`)**: Contains projects built with React.
- **C++ Algorithms (`cppalgorithms/`)**: Various C++ algorithms including data structures, sorting, searching, and more.
- **JavaScript Projects (`jsprojects/`)**: Projects built using vanilla JavaScript, including web apps and games.
- **Python Projects (`pythonproject/`)**: Projects focusing on data analysis, web scraping, and automation in Python.

You can navigate into each folder to find the corresponding projects or algorithms for that technology.

## Contributing Guidelines

We follow a structured process for contributions to maintain a clean and organized repository. Please make sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file before making any contributions. Here's a brief outline:

- **Folder Creation**: Ensure that each project is placed in the appropriate folder. For new technologies, create a new folder.
- **Project Naming**: Follow the format `[technology]project/[your-project-name]` (e.g., `reactproject/my-react-app`).
- **Code Quality**: Please adhere to the code style guidelines mentioned in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
- **Commit Messages**: Follow the conventional commit format:
  ```
  [feature|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore]: Subject (e.g., feat: add new feature)
  ```
- **Pull Requests**: All contributions must go through a pull request (PR) and be reviewed by maintainers.

For detailed instructions, check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the necessary development environment set up based on the technology you are working on.
  - For **React Projects**: Node.js, npm/yarn
  - For **C++ Algorithms**: C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
  - For **JavaScript Projects**: Modern web browser, Node.js (optional)
  - For **Python Projects**: Python 3.x, pip

### Cloning the Repository

To get started with any project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hacktoberfest2024.git
cd Hacktoberfest2024
```

### Running a Project

Navigate to the specific folder for the project you're interested in, and follow the instructions in the project's individual `README.md` file.

For example, to run a React project:

```bash
cd reactproject/my-react-app
npm install
npm start
```

To run a C++ algorithm:

```bash
cd cppalgorithms/sorting-algorithms
g++ quicksort.cpp -o quicksort
./quicksort
```
